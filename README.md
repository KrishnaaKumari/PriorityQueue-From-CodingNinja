# PriorityQueue-From-CodingNinja

#What is PQ?
addition of element in PQ is based on Queue
removal of element is PQ is based on Priority
it can be max-PQ (max priority element will come out first)
       or min-PQ (min priority elment will come out first)

# Operations in PQ
1. Insert
2. Get min/max
3. Remove min/max

# TimeComplexity
In balanced binary tree insert(O(log n)), get(O(log n)), remove(O(log n))
but in heaps timecomplexity is same but easy to implement

# Heap
1. Complete binary tree
2. heap order property

# Complete Binary tree
1. binary tree
2. after completion of nodes in one level you should start nexr level
3. Order of adding nodes is left to right

root is level 0
Min number of nodes in cbt at level 3? 8
Max number of nodes in cbt at level 3? 15

in array if a node is present at index i then its child are present at index 2i+1 and 2i+2
vice-versa to get parent ; do i-1/2 ;

# Heap Order property
1. min heap[every node have priority < child's priority]
2. max heap[every node have priority > child's priority]
